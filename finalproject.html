                                As a part of the Engineering course in PESIT we were supposed to complete a project which culminated an entire semester's work.

                                For this project I was guided by my Professor <b> Dr. Viraj Kumar </b> and two other external guides (1) <b>Dr. Arvind Seshadri of IBM Research </b> and (2) <b>Dr. Sriram Rajamani of Microsoft Research</b>. I was tasked to develop a system which could provide a secure and trust-worthy experience for offline quiz-taking. The results of this project were published as a paper and also a poster was presented in the <b>IBM I-Care 2016 Conference</b>.

                                Today automated assessment in online courses (MOOCs, SPOCS, etc.)
                                is done in a client-server fashion. The only trusted component is the server as it
                                is run by the test creator. The user accesses the automated assessment module by
                                logging into the server using their mobile device. The server sends questions to
                                the user’s device one-by-one. For each question, the user types their answer into
                                their device, which is then transmitted to the server for evaluation and scoring.
                                This process requires constant internet connectivity on the user’s device, which
                                may be a difficult requirement in developing nations. For evaluating complex
                                assignments, it also places significant load on the server. This paper is aims to
                                address these issues by providing a secure offline solution for the automated assessment
                                problem. An offline approach performs the evaluation and scoring on
                                the user’s mobile device and we must protect the evaluation and scoring process
                                from being tampered by the user. To achieve this, we divide the assessment module
                                into two parts:<ol> <li> An untrusted user facing GUI component, and </li><li> A trusted
                                enclave component that handles the evaluation and scoring, and use a hardwarerooted
                                isolated execution technology (ARM TrustZone) to create an isolated enclave
                                for the execution of the enclave component.</li></ol> The execution of the enclave
                                component remains untampered due to the isolation provided by ARM Trust-
                                Zone. With this approach we can successfully encourage the adoption of online
                                courses in developing nations with limited internet connectivity and also reduce
                                the load on the server during the assessment.
